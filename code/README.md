## Introduction

The Quicksort algorithm is a widely used sorting algorithm known for its efficiency. This program demonstrates the algorithm's performance on datasets of different sizes.

## Usage

The main program generates random datasets, applies the Quicksort algorithm, and measures the execution time for each dataset size. The results are then printed to the console.

## Dataset Sizes

The program uses the following dataset sizes for analysis:

- 1000
- 5000
- 10000
- 15000
- 20000

## Execution Time

The execution time is measured in milliseconds for each dataset size. The results are printed in the following format:


## How to Run

To compile and run the program, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed.
2. Clone this repository or download the `quicksort.cpp` file.
3. Compile the program using your preferred C++ compiler.
4. Run the executable.

```bash
g++ quicksort.cpp -o quicksort
./quicksort
